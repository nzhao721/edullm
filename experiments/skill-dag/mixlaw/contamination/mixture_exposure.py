"""Per-arm contaminated exposure for a domain-weighting experiment.

A domain-weighting experiment manipulates the domain mixture directly, so the
exposure weighting is the mixture itself:

    exposure(arm) = sum over domains of  weight(arm, d) * rate(d)

Two rates are reported because they answer different questions:

  - `matched_span_word_rate` -- the fraction of an arm's training WORDS that
    sit inside a verified eval-item match. This is the contaminated-text
    density the arm actually trains on.
  - `matched_document_rate` -- the fraction of its DOCUMENTS carrying a match.
    Reported for comparability with published figures; it is length-biased.

Why this matters here. Contamination varies by domain far more than most
other axes an experiment might manipulate -- on the reservoir this pipeline
scans, the matched-span word rate spans multiple orders of magnitude across
the 7 domains (see the per-domain table in `README.md`). A domain-weighting
experiment moves weight across exactly that axis, so its arms can differ in
contaminated exposure by a large factor by construction.

Note what this does and does not establish. It is the exposure differential,
not an effect on the training endpoint. Whether contamination moved bpb is a
separate question this script does not answer.

Reads a `validation_mixtures_*.json`-shaped file directly: a
`domain_order` list and a `mixtures` list of `{id, run_name, tag, weights}`,
`weights` a list aligned to `domain_order`. This is the same schema
`validation_mixtures_10b.json` in this directory already uses, so it can be
pointed at that file with no conversion step.

`validation_mixtures_10b.json` lists the four arms validated at 370M, the
same four named in its own `README.md`'s "Arms actually run (370M)" table.
Pass `--include` when you want exposure for a subset of them.
